            <P> Hi everyone, my name is Rebecca, I am from China and currently living in Auckland. I have been living in 
            New Zealand for more than 10 years. I finished my college and university study here. I have an electrical engineering and 
            networking background; but, coding and web development are totally new topics to me.  New adventure, HOORAY! </P> 

            <P> I will describe myself as an extroverted introvert. I am adventurous and curious, but sometimes I am a bit shy among
            people.  I love to travel, to experience different culture, to communicate with local people and to see the local lifestyle
            in each country. I had been to different countries and had been through some unforgettable moments: a magnitude of 6.7
            earthquake in Japan, a bomb attack 4km away from my hotel in Egypt, stuck in hotel due to ISIS attack in Ankara Turkey...
            Of course, most of my travel experiences are amazing, good and safe. However, being through those incidents makes me 
            realize how blessed I am to live in New Zealand, a beautiful country with friendly people around. I like the kiwi culture.      
            The reason why I join the course at dev-academy is because I have always desired to have the ability to implement my thoughts
            into a visual form and this course will help me to achieve this. Also, I would like to start my career as a web developer.</P>
