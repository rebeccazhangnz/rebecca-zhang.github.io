              <p class="cultrual-blog-paragraphs">Emotional intelligence is the quality that enables us to confront with patience,
                 insight and imagination the many problems that we face in our affective relationship with ourselves and with others. </p>

              <P Class = "cultrual-blog-subtitle">How is it different to IQ? </P>
              <p class="cultrual-blog-paragraphs">Emotion, according to the experts, is an unconscious state, distinct from cognition (thinking),
                 volition (will) or motivation. Intelligence, on the other hand, is “a set of cognitive abilities which allows us to acquire
                  knowledge, to learn and to solve problems.” Given this, IQ and EQ seem like contradition, however Emotional Intelligence is not
                   the opposite of intelligence. Rather it is a unique intersection of the two that can enable you to use your emotions to help 
                   you solve problems and live a more effective life . </p>

              <P Class = "cultrual-blog-subtitle">Why is it important? </P>
              
              <p class="cultrual-blog-paragraphs">In the past thirty years, people had so much research about what creates performance and
                 success in business and careers. What they found is that people who are successful, the number one factor is not IQ but EQ.
                  People with high IQ may learn faster and react faster then the others, however if they do not understand how to control their
                   emotions or how to handle relationships, they would not be productive. People have low EQ will have highs and lows in their
                    emotions, which means their performance will not be consistent.  The ability to work with emotions is critical in being
                     success, the ability to regulate our emotion is a key to be productive and to keep up consistent performance. </p>
