              <p class="words-from-friend">Strengths: </p>
              <div class="cultrual-blog-paragraphs">
              <p>- My commitment to work and study. I always put extra effort to achieve my career/study goals. </p>
              <p>- I am well organised. I review my study plan everyday and make sure myself complete the tasks on time.</p>
              <p>- My desire of learning new things.</p>
              <p>- Team work, I respect people and I am willing to give support and share my knowledges when is needed.</p>

              <p class="words-from-friend">Limitations:</p>
              <p>- I have no programming background which I might need more time to understand the concepts and materials.</p>
              <p>- I am too humble and shy, i concern other's feeling very much and sometimes I might not speak up my thoughts and ideas.</p>
              <p>- Sometimes I feel stress and anxious when I get stuck.</p>
              <p>- English as a second language.</p>

              <p class="cultrual-blog-subtitle">How will I manage my workload in this program</p>
              <p>During the self-driven course, I will go over the structure of the sprint and set up a weekly study plan for myself. I will review my study plan each day to make sure I am on the right track. My goal is to work at least 8 hours per day and may be having some stretch to 10 to 12 hours if I feel left behind or If I want to explore more. I will take a 5 mins regular break every hour to stretch my body, and have some fresh air, these help me to refresh my brain, so that I can stay focus through out the day. I will also attend the weekly workshop and update my faciliator with my progress. For the bootcamp, I am commited that i will follow facilitator's instructions to complete the daily tasks. I will be fully commited to the projects, giving support and learn from my cohorts.</p>

              <p class="cultrual-blog-subtitle">How and Where will I seek help in timely way?</p>
              <p>When I get stuck, I will try to review the problem myself. If I still can not resolve it, I will search it on google or different forums, as this is the usually way when we working in the development industry. If I still have no hints, then I will seek help from my cohorts and facilitors by using slack or emailing them.</p>

              <p class ="cultrual-blog-subtitle">What do I expect from the facilitation team?</p>
              <p>I would expect the facilitation team to give support when help is needed, as well as give me advices or share their experience on learning software development.
