                    <p>
                        Core learning has been helping me to reflect myself, to understand more about myself and to build my emotional strength. Through the 
                        practice of mindfulness and growth mindset, I feel that it has been easier for me to control on my emotions then before. Thus I can stay
                         focus for longer and become more efficient and productive.
                    </p>
           
                    <P Class = "cultrual-blog-subtitle">What are 1 - 3 new things you have learned about yourself as a result of the core learning?</P>
                    <p class = "words-from-friend">- Emotional Intelligence</p>
                    <p>I get stressed easily, and i would have sudden emotional outbursts.  After the study of EQ, I realised those are signs
                       of low EQ. Luckily, I also learned that EQ is highly malleable, as we train our brain by repeatedly practicing new emotionally
                       intelligent behaviors, it builds the pathways that  are needed to make them into habit. Therefore I have started to write down
                       self reflections and pratice mindfulness to help me develop my EQ.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "words-from-friend">- Growth Mindset</p>
                    <p>I was a person that had a strong fixed mindset, I avoided challenges and I believed that I would not be success as I have no talents.
                       The study of growth mindset really helps me in this course and changes my thoughts alot.  When I get stucked in the Kata challenges,
                       I felt like I was too stupid to study programming. I was terrified and could not even finish a simple challenge, I wanted to give up.
                       However the growth mindset study really saves me, it makes me realise that practicing and efforts are the keys for improvement. 
                       After study growth mindset, I started to face challenges, whenever I get stucked, instead of give up, I started to apply the problem
                       solving skills and tried different solutions. Eventually I found that, programming is not that scary, it just takes time to understand. 
                    </p>
                    

                    <P Class = "cultrual-blog-subtitle">What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </P>
                    <p>
                       At the start of this course, I had no idea that why we need to study about human skills. The course was very intensive and I wanted to
                       spend more time on learning programming instead of understanding myself and writing blogs. However my thought changes week by week. I
                       could never have imagined that core study really changes my mindset and improved my study efficiency. Keeping myself emotionally stable
                       really helps me stay focus on things. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <P Class = "cultrual-blog-subtitle">What was the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </P>
                    <p>
                       Meditation is a big challenge for me, as there are always lots of thoughts in my head. I am a relatively sensitive person, I am easily
                       influenced by the surrounding environments. I could not stay focus When I was doing the meditation practice using Headspace app.
                    </p>

                    <P Class = "cultrual-blog-subtitle">Any thoughts you want to share about your core learning journey in Foundations?</P>
                    <p>
                       I think core study is essential, it really helps people to stay emotionally stable in this intensive course. Those skills are important
                       and necessary in everyday life and career as well.
