              <ul> 
                  <li>
                    Well naming each element, object and function, A good name should be short and clear
                    and describes the purpose of the code. So that we do not need to provide unnecessary comments in the script to the explain 
                    the codes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Indentation/formatting your code where necessary. Indentation has no bearing on how the page is rendered, but it has a 
                    huge effect on the readability of the code. It makes the tree structure more clear and it would help people to breakdown
                    the codes into sections and maintaining things become easier.  Standard procedure is to indent one tab (or a few spaces)
                    when you are starting a new element that is a child element of the tag above it. Then move back in a tab when you are 
                    closing that element. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Having consistency in how you name things and how you format your code reduces confusion when others read it.  For example,
                    if you have a class for your index navigation bar call “nav-bar”, and you are having another class for your blog page’s
                    navigation bar. You should not use “navBar” as another class name, because it would be confused for people to understand
                    the difference between the two. Instead, you should make the code more consistent by using the same naming method (dash
                    in between words). Eg. nav-bar-blog.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Commenting a complicated section. If the code or the function in your script is long and complicated, it is good to
                      have comments to explained the purpose of that section. This helps people to get some ideas before reading your code.

                  <p>
                      When I first finished the basic JavaScript Course, I was trying to find some online coding challenges to practice the knowledge
                      I had learned. The first challenge I came across was to write a function that will return the factorial of a given number 
                      (eg. Given 3, return the result of 1*2*3). I know it sounds pretty simple and straight forward, but guess what? At that time, 
                      I did not even know how to start, I was frightened. I understood the requiements, I knew how to set conditions and loops, but 
                      how could I put the knowledges together to get the results? I was stucked. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I decided to refer back to the jscourse on freeCodeCamp, I found out that there was a technique called pseudocode. That technique
                      helps people to brief the ideas before writing the code. The concept of pseudocode is like making a meal for your family. Writing
                      down a menu first would help you decide the ingredients and the steps you need to follow.Pseudocode is the menu of the code script.
                      After I wrote the pseudocode for the factorial challenge, the idea became clear in my brain, then it took me only 2 minutes to 
                      write the functions according to the pseudocode. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <div class = "blog-sub-question text-left">2. Solved a problem in an elegant way</div>
                  <p>
                      I remembered when I first created my blog page I was very struggle with the positioning of the elements. When I tried to make one
                      block of content to be float, the position of other blocks changed as well.  It was a mess seeing all the texts and images stacked
                      on top of each other. Then I did some research on google and found out the rules of  float properties. Basically we can imagine 
                      that if an element is defined as float, it is not on the same layer to the other elements, and that’s why the other elements will
                      shift to take over the empty space. To resolve the issue, we can simply tell the other elements to ignore the float effect by 
                      using “clear” property.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      There are many rules that affect the layout of the webpage, we will not be able to understand all of them. When we get stucked,
                      google is a good way to search for answers.
                  </p>

                  <div class = "blog-question text-left">* Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</div>
                  <ul> 
                      <li>
                          <span>Pseudocode</span> : High – Pseudocode is a very useful technicque for me to conceptualise my code, it breaks down the problem into
                           pieces then I can solve it step by step.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <span> Trying something</span> : High – Trying things out might not solve the problem straight away, but it gives me the ideas what ways 
                          are not working, and hence I can find another way to approach the problem.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <span> Rubber ducky method</span> : Medium – I might not speak out lound to an object, but I will sometimes repeat and review the
                           problem/steps in my mind.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <span> Reading error messages</span> : High – I like to read error messages, as most of the time it points out the problem straight
                           away, or it points to the sections the problem locates. Debugging codes without any error message is a real challenge to me.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <span> Console.logging </span> : Medium – Sometimes I am not quite sure where should I put the console.log to check the output.  
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <span> Googling</span> : High - The major problem solving skill that I use in my daily tasks.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <span> Googling</span> : Medium – This sometimes would be a challenge as people might have different logic or approach on writing
                           codes. It was a bit hard to explain things when people have different logic,  and the process is time consuming. 
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <span> Asking coaches for help</span> : Medium – This would be my final solution if I could not solve the problem by myself, 
                          because in a working environment, there might not be a coach out there to help me.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <span> Improving your process with reflection</span> : Medium – Still working on this part.
