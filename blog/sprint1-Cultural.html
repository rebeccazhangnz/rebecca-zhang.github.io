              <p class="cultrual-blog-paragraphs">I had never thought about my peronal values before I joined dev-academy , so I was not sure what it was. I tried to avoid being subjective and one-sieded on this self-assessment,  therefore I had asked few of my friends and used some of the online tools to help me with this task. </p>
              <p class="words-from-friend">- Emily ( Friend of mine for 10 years ): </p>

              <p Class = "cultrual-blog-questions">* Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</p>
              <p class = "cultrual-blog-paragraphs">I had to make an ethical decision of moving away from my parents and living by myself in New Zealand. This might sound easy for some people, however it is not an easy move for an only child in a Chinese family. As the traditional Chinese culture, children are responsible for taking care of their parents when they get old. Therefore most of the Chinese people will choose to stay close with their parents, ie. living in the same city.  However, I believe that being independent and having the courage to pursue my dream are the key values in becoming success. </p>
              <p class = "cultrual-blog-paragraphs">I had been welly protected by my family since I was born, I did not need to worry about anything as everything was prepared for me. When I first moved out, I stuggled a lot. I thought that 24 hours for a day was never enough; I had to work, to study and to take care all the bits and pieces of myself, challenges were everywhere. However, I have never douted the decision I made, because challenges are opportunities for growth. After all these years, I have learned how to plan and prioritise different tasks, how to balance work and personal life, how to take care of myself as well as others. This is a life-long lesson and I am pursuing a better vesion of myself everyday.</p>

              <p class = "cultrual-blog-questions">* Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</p>
              <p class = "cultrual-blog-paragraphs">I learn moral values mainly within my family and my identity is largely shaped by the Chinese Culture.  The traditional Chinese cultural values that influence me the most are courtesy, self-discipline, commitment and team work. As Confucius said “The mind of the superior man is conversant with righteousness; the mind of the mean man is conversant with gain”.  I was taught to be discipline and not to be selfish since I was young. I have always believed that people should seek for both personal success and team-achievement. </p>

              <p class ="cultrual-blog-questions">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</p>
              <p class ="cultrual-blog-paragraphs">Self-discipline,  commitment and desire to learn would be my strenghths in terms of learning and career development.</p>
              <p class ="cultrual-blog-paragraphs">My strenghths in terms of learning and career development are the ability to prioritise things, attention to details, commitment, team work and the desire to learn new things. My biggest limitation for my career development would be that I am too humble and shy. I concern other’s feeling very much and sometimes I might not speak up my thoughts and ideas. </p>
              <p class ="cultrual-blog-questions">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how thy might intersect with learning obstacles </p>
              <p class ="cultrual-blog-paragraphs">I have always been commited to my work and putting extra effort to achieve more on my career path. I was a technicial support at my work, I had been given proper training from my company to complete my daily tasks, however I was eager to learn more and develop more about myself. Then I decided to complete a certificate of proficiency on computer network while I am working.  My time magagement and organisational skills allow me to find the balance beteen work and study, and I have sucessfully completed my degree and still have exceptional performance on my work. </p>
              <p class ="cultrual-blog-questions">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why. </p>
              <p class ="cultrual-blog-paragraphs">Previously I worked as a mentor in my team and was responsible for training new people, making sure they are familiar with our company workflow and systems. The newbies came from different backgrounds and had different approach on learning new things, hence there were a large difference on their learning progress. Some people learned much faster than the others. People came asking me same questions at different times, I had to stop and explain the same concept again and again. </p>
              <p class ="cultrual-blog-paragraphs">I realized that I had to find a way to improve the training efficiency. I created a trello page (an online tasks management tool), shared the FAQs on the page, so that I could direct people to the page to find the answers themselves. In that way, I did not need to slow down the training progress of the whole team, at the same time people can find answers in their own time according to their learning progress.  I have been using the same technique for my daily tasks to share information with my team mates.</p>
              <p class ="cultrual-blog-paragraphs">I would say that was not the best approach for a training situation, because some people might look for the answers straight away before trying to find the answers by themselves.  It I have a chance to be in that situation again, I would take more collaborative approaches, for example creating a SLACK platform and let people helping each other. </p>
