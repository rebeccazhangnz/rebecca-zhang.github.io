        <div class = "blog-question text-left">* An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</div>

        <div class="inline-blog-body text-left"> HTML  is used to design the structure of websites, it contains various <tags> that hold 
          contents and section up the pages. Each of the <tags> has different values and attributes that can be defined by the CSS
             (Cascading Style Sheet). The HTML contents are raw datas, they look plain and boring by default, Using CSS can provide the 
             appearnce and styling to the HTML contents.  Here is an example of "GitHub Guide” website with and without CSS styling:
        </div> 
        <div class="inline-blog-body"> 
            <img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid inline-blog-img" src="../images/GitHub-css.png" alt="Github-page-with-CSS-styling!">

        </div>
        <div class="inline-blog-body text-left">If you have ever made a cake or seen the process of making a cake, you can think of HTML 
          is the sponge cake base, you can use HTML to decide how many layers the cake is going to be and CSS is what gives the decorations
           and flavours of the cake.

        <div class = "blog-question text-left">*Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 
          'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</div>

        <div class="inline-blog-body text-left">The above function will count from 0 to 60 minutes, each count is one loop. During the loop, 
          it will check if it is the time to move to the next cycle. If the current count is under 30 minutes, it falls in the wash cycle, 
          and so on.

       <div class = "blog-question text-left">* Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</div>


      <div class="inline-blog-body text-left">The Document Object Model (DOM) is and application programming interface for HTML documents. It 
        allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the contents, struture and styles of a document(eg. The webpage/html
         document). As you would know from the first section of this blog, HTML are plained datas and CSS is the style settings , those are 
         static scripts. Imagine that you have set the hover style in CSS, how is it gonna show on the browser? How would it know the mouse is
          on the hyper link? How would it know you have click on the link and is time to bring you to the linked page?  DOM will do the job! 
          DOM enables scripts to access document elements and manipulate the datas. It acts like a glue that ties HTML, CSS , and java scripts 
          together. 
    </div>

    <div class="inline-blog-body text-left">DOM is a hierarchical model as shown below:
    </div>

     <div class="inline-blog-body"> 
        <img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid inline-blog-img" src="../images/DOMtree.jpg" alt="DOM-tree-img!">
     </div>

     <div class="inline-blog-body text-left"><p>Every HTML element within the document is an object in the eyes of the DOM (eg. &lthead&gt,&ltbody&gt,
       &ltdiv&gt etc.) DOM basically describes how the objects are laid out in a tree fashion and each object is called the node. JavaScript
          works with the objects, it can call methods on document objects thru DOM and interact with them, below is an example of getting
          objects from DOM: </p>

          <p class="css-codes">Document.getElementByTagName(title) </p>
        
        <p>This gets the information from the &lttitle&gt tag of the HTML element.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "blog-question text-left">* Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. </div>

    <div class="inline-blog-body text-left"> <p>Data in arrays is referenced by its position while data in an object is referenced by its
       defined-properties.</p>
       <div class="inline-blog-body array-img"> 
          <img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid inline-blog-img" src="../images/Array.png" alt="Array-img!">
       </div>
       <p>As showing in the picture above, the data stored in an array is call element, each element has a refrenced position in regard to the array
          length. To access the data within an array, we could use the bracket notation “[ ]” to specify the position of the data. For example 
          <span class = "css-codes">arrayName[3]</span>, this calls the 4th element inside the array. Note that numbering begins with 0 in programming world, therefore arrayName [n]
           calls the n+1 th element in that array.</p>

           <div class="inline-blog-body array-img"> 
              <img class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid inline-blog-img" src="../images/object-representation.png" alt="java-object-img!">
           </div>
           <p>Unlike array, data stored in an object is not refrenced by position. When we create an object, we assign a name to each data set
          and it is called the property. We use properties to reference data within an object. For example, see the picture above, the names
          stored in JSobject are the properties, each of the property refers to a set of data. We can use <span class = "css-codes">JSobject[Extra Properties]</span>
          to access the array which contains property “c” and “d”. Or we can use <span class = "css-codes">JSobject.Elements</span> 
          to access the array which contains property “0”, “1” & “2”. Generally we use bracket notation “[ ]” to access property has space
          in its name. And dot notation “.” is use for normal cases. However there are other situations that bracket notation is required.

     <div class = "blog-question text-left">* Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</div>
     <div class="inline-blog-body text-left"><p>Function or a method is a piece of code which performs some operations and optionally returns a value.
        Functions are useful to break the codes up into smaller bits, so that it is more organised. Also, functions are reusable, it can be call
         whenever you want without rewrite the code over and over again.  </p>
